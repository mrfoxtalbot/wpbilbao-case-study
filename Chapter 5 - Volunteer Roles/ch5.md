# WordPress Bilbao - Case Study

# Chapter 5 - Volunteer Roles

It's very important to let people participate in the community, and no just one guy organizing the Meetups.

That's why, thanks to Slack, we manage the community workflow.

## Role Examples

* **Bloggers:** some of the community members write about news or meetups reviews.
* **Videos:** other members recrod the meetups and upload them to Youtube.
* **Translators:** as we have two languages here, Basque and Spanish, some of the members translate the articles.

## Trello

We use a simple Trello dashboard to manage the task workflow, column examples:

* **Pending:** we have task templates to just duplicate and use
* **Doing:** the member takes a task and starts doing it
* **Translate Pending:** in case of needed, the blogger assigns the task to the translators. One of the translators takes the task and moves to te next column.
* **Translating:** same as doing but for translators
* **Pending to Post:** the translator assigns the task to an Editor and after review it, the article it's publish.

Thanks to Custom Post Types and Custom Fields, we can make easier to add new meetups reviews so anyone can participate and contribute.

In a meetup review there is always nearly the same information:

* Review
* Slides URL
* Youtube Video URL
* Twitter tweets URL
* Meetup.com Event URL
* Writer
* Translator

## Gamification

It's important that contributors can feel that are part of the community so the get more involved. That's why when someone writes or translates an article, or records/uploads a video, their image appears.

Their profile image and a link to their profile appears in the sidebar of the article or the video.
